  <h3>Our Story</h3>
  <br>
  <div>
  <h4>His Version</h4>
    <p>It all started, funnily enough, with a Facebook poke. And by the girl, for a change. It quickly moved to Facebook chats and then to sleepless midnight texting, all the while never really going beyond casual hi’s while in college. And it took a film festival few months later to really bring us together. Our Madam somehow thought an erotic movie deceptively titled as “Sleeping beauty” was a good place to start for two awkward people who just knew each other through chats but rarely talked much in real life. But hey, it worked! Her carefree attitude and rebellious nature got me completely hooked and thus it began.<br><br>
After college, while I took the boring, safe option of a B-school, Madam was busy trying to figure out her life. Within a year, she was in Hyderabad studying English Literature while I was toiling away in Calcutta, pretending to learn what being a manager is all about. Long distance was tough, but the best thing that came out of it- knowing that we are in it for the long haul, along with the horrible sinking realization that I MAY have to endure this woman for the rest of my life.<br><br>
A few more years, and we decided long distance is no longer cutting it. Hence Bangalore happened, where she is now a college professor (a strict one I presume) and I am making a living out of pretending to be a manager. We enjoy the smaller things in life, getting to know each other more, and having loads of fun along the way. Our favourite pastime- judging younger couples around us. “We definitely weren’t this cheesy”<br><br>
Oh yeah, sure we weren’t!!!

  <h4>Her Version</h4>
    <p>It all happened on an ordinary evening in my college hostel. Inspiration struck and I ‘poked’ Arun Sasikumar on Facebook, a name I had heard so many times but never had the chance to meet. Final year and all, seemed like the ideal time to make new friends. *wink* Surprisingly, he poked back and we continued this for a couple of MONTHS! And then we texted for the next couple of MONTHS. (Slow, this guy). Luckily, I got my hands on a pass for an international film festival in the city, an ideal intellectual excuse to go out with a guy. Needless to say, it worked. Though in a totally unexpected way. Anyway, when in doubt, be a nerd. <br><br>
Did I know if he was the one? No, not really. But I sure didn’t have time to think of ‘the one’. This one had killed me with his wicked sense of humour, his straightforwardness and his insane amount of empathy. He was the logical one, I was the one with head-in-the clouds. We made sense to me. And nonsensically, I was falling for him.<br><br>
And then began the long-distance affair after we graduated. He went on to b-school to learn how to screw others over. As for me, I graduated engineering just so that I didn’t screw myself over. I gallivanted around experimenting with jobs, eliminating one career option after the other trying to figure out where my interest lay since it definitely wasn’t in engineering. He, from across the country, send me his trust in what I was doing. Nutcase, I tell you. It took me a year to realize my calling was in the Arts, the creative stuff. We continued with our cross-country romance while I was pursuing my higher studies in Literature. It was the little things that I missed that made it so hard. The silver lining to it all was that sudden enlightenment that dawned on Mr Sasi that I am his chosen one. (Slow much?). Needless to say, I rolled my eyes. <br><br>
Mr Sasi went out into the world to play the cool manager. A year later, I became a college professor. But it didn’t change the fact that we were both still in two different parts of the country. Mr Sasi decided that enough is enough and moved to Bangalore to be in the same city as me. Awwww… It wasn’t long before we decided to take the plunge. There wasn’t even the need for a proposal. So, if you are looking for a juicy story about a proposal, sorry! Go back and read other things because there’s none here. (Read between the lines: I swear to hang this over his head for the rest of his life!)
